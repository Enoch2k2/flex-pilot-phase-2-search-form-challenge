# Search Practice Challenge

For this challenge you will need to implement these features:

1. Create a form for creating books that we will be searching through later
2. Each book should have a title, an author, and a genre
3. When you create a book, it should be listed in the List component as a ListItem component.
4. Create a search form in the List.jsx, the search form should filter out the array of books being displayed. Capitilization shouldn't matter and should accept substrings.
5. **Bonus**: If you are finished with the above, then try to implement a filter button that will filter any book of a specific genre, for example: A button that has fantasy that when you click, will filter all the books by the genre of fantasy.
